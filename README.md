The name of the game is Crystal Collector. The main objective of the game is to match your total score with the Randomly Generated Number that is presented at the start of the game. To add to your total score you can click on four different crystal. Each crystal has a value that is hidden to the user. Each time you click on a crystal your total goes up by the value of the crystal that is clicked on. Each crystal will have a randomly generated value that can only be found if you click on the crystal. If the total score matches the value of the randomly generated score the game is one and the win value goes up by one. If the total score is more than the randomly generated value the game is lost and the loss value goes up by one. After a win or a loss the a new randomly generated value is shown and the four crystals also recieve new random values.
